Welcome to the team's website on works done for ISSS608 Group Project: 
Challenge 3: Economic considers the financial health of the city.
 Over time, are businesses growing or shrinking? How are people changing jobs? Are standards of living improving or declining over time?
Considering the financial status of Engagementâ€™s businesses and residents, this site addresses these questions using visual analytic techniques

1. Over the period covered by the dataset, which businesses appear to be more prosperous? Which appear to be struggling? 
2. How does the financial health of the residents change over the period covered by the dataset? 
How do wages compare to the overall cost of living in Engagement? Are there groups that appear to exhibit similar patterns? 
3. Describe the health of the various employers within the city limits. What employment patterns do you observe?
Do you notice any areas of particularly high or low turnover?
