However,ideally, such tools should be\nopen source, freely available and allow contributions or modifications\nby users. Inspired by Prof Kam, with the acquired coding skills and\nunderstanding of data ,this group project aims to create such flexible\nwebsite by making use of interactive visualizations to answer questions\nfrom VAST Challenge\n2022 Challenge 3 to find out the Economic status of the City of\nEngagement, Ohio USA.\nProblem Statements\nFollowing are the questions we aim to answer, referencing from VAST\nChallenge 2022 Challenge 3 questions:\nChallenge 3: Economic considers the financial\nhealth of the city. Over time, are businesses growing or shrinking? How\nare people changing jobs? Are standards of living improving or declining\nover time?\nConsider the financial status of Engagement’s businesses and\nresidents, and use visual analytic techniques to address these\nquestions.\nOver the period covered by the dataset, which businesses appear to\nbe more prosperous? Which appear to be struggling? Describe your\nrationale for your answers. Limit your response to 10 images and 500\nwords.\nHow does the financial health of the residents change over the\nperiod covered by the dataset? How do wages compare to the overall cost\nof living in Engagement? Are there groups that appear to exhibit similar\npatterns? Describe your rationale for your answers. Limit your response\nto 10 images and 500 words.\nDescribe the health of the various employers within the city limits.\nWhat employment patterns do you observe? Do you notice any areas of\nparticularly high or low turnover? Limit your response to 10 images and\n500 words.\nApproach\nQuestion 1\nIt is observed from the datasets provided by VAST Challenge 2022\nthat there are two types of businesses present in Engagement, Ohio USA,\nnamely:\nRestaurants;\nPubs\nThey will be evaluated based on:\nFrequency and number of participants’ visits;\nRevenue (participants’ spending)\nAccording to the dataset descriptions provided by VAST Challenge, all\nrestaurants have a Prix Fixe food cost for participants to dine in and\nall pubs have a hourly cost to visit the pub. Therefore, assuming all\nvisits to restaurants are for dinning, restaurants’ revenue will be\ncalculated by number of visits times Prix Fixe food cost. Similarly,\npubs’ revenue will be calculated by duration of visits times hourly cost\nof visits.\nAlternative approach of deriving balance difference before and after\nrestaurants and pubs visits as spending is considered but not preferred\nas balance differences are inconsistent and could be due to unknown\nreasons.\nQuestion 2\nOne question which rides in the minds of every reader who resides or\ndoes not reside in a city is - How expensive or affordable is the cost\nof living here? Can a resident residing here build up a good bank\nbalance over the years?\nKeeping the sample of 1000 participants in mind, this segment will\nhelp study the financial health of each of the participants.\nThe FinancialJournal.csv helps understand the expense in\ncategories such as Food, Recreation, Shelter and Earnings such as Wage.\n(Assumption : All positive values corresponds to credit and negative\nones are debited)\nTrellis Display can be used to understand the cost of living\nof each of the participants. This will also give us an idea on the\nliving index of the city over the months to see if the living standard\nincreased over the months which may have motivated participants to leave\nthe city.\nThe sample collected consists of diverse participants. Participants\ncan be partitioned based on the educational qualifications, Number of\nHousehold members, Interest groups (A-H), Age groups, etc. We can use\nsuch partitions to our favour to understand the similarity between\ngroups.\nSince we are dealing with our data in monthly format, Column\nGraph can help us understand the expenses incurred by these\ngroups.\nRidge plot can help us understand the distribution in the\nexpenses over months during peak and off peak seasons\nTo understand the earning pattern of the participants, a Lorenz\ncurve can help us understand if the rich gets richer.\nWith the help of Interactive/Coordinated plots (Example: Scattered\nplot), we can also understand if people who earn more, spend more and if\nwe see any relation with joviality.\nQuestion 3\nFinancial health of the\nemployers\nBy merging jobs.csv and employers.csv by\nemployerId, we can find out which employer pays more and thereby we can\narrive to the conclusion of financial status of employers.\nAlso by deriving Which employers have the record of most numbers of\nemployees switching jobs, we’ll understand their workspace culture and\nhow likely the employer(company) may be referred to ?\nEmployment patterns\nWe can also find out how many jobs does each Workplace provding with\nthe help of jobs.csv and employers.csv\nAlso, with the help of jobs.csv file, let’s try to find if\nthere is any correlation between employees’ pay and their educational\nqualification.\nTurnover Analysis\nTo analyse the turnover, let us have a close look on\nTravelJournal.csv. Once the data wrangling (filtering out the\npurpose of Work/Home commute and grouping by participantId,\ntravelEndLocation) is performed, we are not just finding out the overall\nturnover percentage rate but also with the help of apprpriate\nvisualisation we are able to find out the exact participants who have\ndisappeared from local job market, and who have partially employed by\nexamining the no. of rows (n).\nEarly Prototypes\nReveal the\nprosperity of the restaurants and pubs\nWe propose to use two trellis plots on restaurants and pubs’ number\nof customer visits to illustrate the prosperity of the restaurants and\npubs’ business. The nature of the trellis plot also allows users to sort\nand filter the visualization based on different conditions.\nRestaurant Customer Visit Trellis\nPlotPubs Customer Visit Trellis\nPlotFor example, users can filter by price of the pubs’ hourly cost and\nsort the trellis plot by descending order of the largest number of\nvisits, to find out the most popular pubs in the given price range.\nFilter Pubs by Hourly CostSort Pubs by Highest Number of Costomer\nVisitsUnderstanding\nthe cost of living of Participants\nGraph: Line chart in Trellis Display \nRationale: It will help us to understand the cost of living of each\nand every participant and given the functionality of the Trelliscope, we\ncan add additional filters such as educational background and age group\nto understand the trends amongst such groups\nComparing\nand relating the earning and expenditure trends\nGraph: Scatter plot for each of the components, designed in a\ncoordinated way\n\nRationale: We would be able to highlight and deep dive on unusual\ntrends and the table will help us understand the attributes.\nFinding out the\nsimilarity between groups\nGraph: Column graph depicting the expenditure patterns.\n\nRationale: By creating an animated graph seperated between months, we\ncan observe the rise/fall in the expenditure pattern between groups\nInequality amongst\nparticipants\nGraph: Lorenz curve\n\nRationale: A Lorenz curve is a graphical representation of the\ndistribution of income or wealth within a population.\nThe rise/fall of available\nbalance\nGraph: Slope Graph\n\nRationale: This will help us compare between participants and depict\na graphical representation of the financial health over the months\nUnderstanding\nthe opening and closing monthly expense\nGraph: Candle Stick\n\nRationale: Like the opening and closing figures of stock market, we\ncan notice the same here with the available balance and understand the\npeak months when the expense has been ceiling high.\nGraph : Boxplot\nimage: \nThis boxplot helps us to understand pay of participants with\ndifferent educational qualification. The minimum, maximum, median and\nalso mean pay of the participants for each educational background can be\nexamined.\nGraph : Line chart\nimage: \nThis graph helps us to understand the no. of participants who left a\nworkplace over a period of time.\nGraph : Treemap\nimage: \nThe tree map allows us to look at both the overall prosperous and\nstruggling businesses for each size of the workplace, as well as the\noverall proportion of the business that is contributing to job provision\nbased on the relative size and shade of the shape.\n\n\n\n",
