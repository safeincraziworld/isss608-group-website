However,ideally, such tools should be\r\nopen source, freely available and allow contributions or modifications\r\nby users. Inspired by Prof Kam, with the acquired coding skills and\r\nunderstanding of data ,this group project aims to create such flexible\r\nwebsite by making use of interactive visualizations to answer questions\r\nfrom VAST Challenge\r\n2022 Challenge 3 to find out the Economic status of the City of\r\nEngagement, Ohio USA.\r\nProblem Statements\r\nFollowing are the questions we aim to answer, referencing from VAST\r\nChallenge 2022 Challenge 3 questions:\r\nChallenge 3: Economic considers the financial\r\nhealth of the city. Over time, are businesses growing or shrinking? How\r\nare people changing jobs? Are standards of living improving or declining\r\nover time?\r\nConsider the financial status of Engagement’s businesses and\r\nresidents, and use visual analytic techniques to address these\r\nquestions.\r\nOver the period covered by the dataset, which businesses appear to\r\nbe more prosperous? Which appear to be struggling? Describe your\r\nrationale for your answers. Limit your response to 10 images and 500\r\nwords.\r\nHow does the financial health of the residents change over the\r\nperiod covered by the dataset? How do wages compare to the overall cost\r\nof living in Engagement? Are there groups that appear to exhibit similar\r\npatterns? Describe your rationale for your answers. Limit your response\r\nto 10 images and 500 words.\r\nDescribe the health of the various employers within the city limits.\r\nWhat employment patterns do you observe? Do you notice any areas of\r\nparticularly high or low turnover? Limit your response to 10 images and\r\n500 words.\r\nApproach\r\nQuestion 1\r\nIt is observed from the datasets provided by VAST Challenge 2022\r\nthat there are two types of businesses present in Engagement, Ohio USA,\r\nnamely:\r\nRestaurants;\r\nPubs\r\nThey will be evaluated based on:\r\nFrequency and number of participants’ visits;\r\nRevenue (participants’ spending)\r\nAccording to the dataset descriptions provided by VAST Challenge, all\r\nrestaurants have a Prix Fixe food cost for participants to dine in and\r\nall pubs have a hourly cost to visit the pub. Therefore, assuming all\r\nvisits to restaurants are for dinning, restaurants’ revenue will be\r\ncalculated by number of visits times Prix Fixe food cost. Similarly,\r\npubs’ revenue will be calculated by duration of visits times hourly cost\r\nof visits.\r\nAlternative approach of deriving balance difference before and after\r\nrestaurants and pubs visits as spending is considered but not preferred\r\nas balance differences are inconsistent and could be due to unknown\r\nreasons.\r\nQuestion 2\r\nQuestion 3\r\nEarly Prototypes\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
