Over time, are businesses growing or shrinking? How\r\nare people changing jobs? Are standards of living improving or declining\r\nover time?\r\nConsider the financial status of Engagement’s businesses and\r\nresidents, and use visual analytic techniques to address these\r\nquestions.\r\nOver the period covered by the dataset, which businesses appear to\r\nbe more prosperous? Which appear to be struggling? Describe your\r\nrationale for your answers.

Do you notice any areas of\r\nparticularly high or low turnover? Limit your response to 10 images and\r\n500 words.\r\nApproach\r\nQuestion 1\r\nIt is observed from the datasets provided by VAST Challenge 2022\r\nthat there are two types of businesses present in Engagement, Ohio USA,\r\nnamely:\r\nRestaurants;\r\nPubs\r\nThey will be evaluated based on:\r\nFrequency and number of participants’ visits;\r\nRevenue (participants’ spending)\r\nAccording to the dataset descriptions provided by VAST Challenge, all\r\nrestaurants have a Prix Fixe food cost for participants to dine in and\r\nall pubs have a hourly cost to visit the pub. Therefore, assuming all\r\nvisits to restaurants are for dinning, restaurants’ revenue will be\r\ncalculated by number of visits times Prix Fixe food cost. Similarly,\r\npubs’ revenue will be calculated by duration of visits times hourly cost\r\nof visits.\r\nAlternative approach of deriving balance difference before and after\r\nrestaurants and pubs visits as spending is considered but not preferred\r\nas balance differences are inconsistent and could be due to unknown\r\nreasons.\r\nQuestion 2\r\nOne question which rides in the minds of every reader who resides or\r\ndoes not reside in a city is - How expensive or affordable is the cost\r\nof living here? Can a resident residing here build up a good bank\r\nbalance over the years?\r\nKeeping the sample of 1000 participants in mind, this segment will\r\nhelp study the financial health of each of the participants.\r\nThe FinancialJournal.csv helps understand the expense in\r\ncategories such as Food, Recreation, Shelter and Earnings such as Wage.\r\n(Assumption : All positive values corresponds to credit and negative\r\nones are debited)\r\nTrellis Display can be used to understand the cost of living\r\nof each of the participants. This will also give us an idea on the\r\nliving index of the city over the months to see if the living standard\r\nincreased over the months which may have motivated participants to leave\r\nthe city.\r\nThe sample collected consists of diverse participants. Participants\r\ncan be partitioned based on the educational qualifications, Number of\r\nHousehold members, Interest groups (A-H), Age groups, etc. We can use\r\nsuch partitions to our favour to understand the similarity between\r\ngroups.\r\nSince we are dealing with our data in monthly format, Column\r\nGraph can help us understand the expenses incurred by these\r\ngroups.\r\nRidge plot can help us understand the distribution in the\r\nexpenses over months during peak and off peak seasons\r\nTo understand the earning pattern of the participants, a Lorenz\r\ncurve can help us understand if the rich gets richer.\r\nWith the help of Interactive/Coordinated plots (Example: Scattered\r\nplot), we can also understand if people who earn more, spend more and if\r\nwe see any relation with joviality.\r\nQuestion 3\r\nFinancial health of the\r\nemployers\r\nBy merging jobs.csv and employers.csv by\r\nemployerId, we can find out which employer pays more and thereby we can\r\narrive to the conclusion of financial status of employers.\r\nAlso by deriving Which employers have the record of most numbers of\r\nemployees switching jobs, we’ll understand their workspace culture and\r\nhow likely the employer(company) may be referred to ?\r\nEmployment patterns\r\nWe can also find out how many jobs does each Workplace provding with\r\nthe help of jobs.csv and employers.csv\r\nAlso, with the help of jobs.csv file, let’s try to find if\r\nthere is any correlation between employees’ pay and their educational\r\nqualification.\r\nTurnover Analysis\r\nTo analyse the turnover, let us have a close look on\r\nTravelJournal.csv.
