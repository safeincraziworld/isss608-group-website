However,ideally, such tools should be open source, freely available and allow contributions or modifications by users. Inspired by Prof Kam, with the acquired coding skills and understanding of data ,this group project aims to create such flexible website by making use of interactive visualizations to answer questions from VAST Challenge 2022 Challenge 3 to find out the Economic status of the City of Engagement, Ohio USA.\nProblem Statements\nFollowing are the questions we aim to answer, referencing from VAST Challenge 2022 Challenge 3 questions:\nChallenge 3: Economic considers the financial health of the city. Over time, are businesses growing or shrinking? How are people changing jobs? Are standards of living improving or declining over time?\nConsider the financial status of Engagement’s businesses and residents, and use visual analytic techniques to address these questions.\nOver the period covered by the dataset, which businesses appear to be more prosperous? Which appear to be struggling? Describe your rationale for your answers. Limit your response to 10 images and 500 words.\nHow does the financial health of the residents change over the period covered by the dataset? How do wages compare to the overall cost of living in Engagement? Are there groups that appear to exhibit similar patterns? Describe your rationale for your answers. Limit your response to 10 images and 500 words.\nDescribe the health of the various employers within the city limits. What employment patterns do you observe? Do you notice any areas of particularly high or low turnover? Limit your response to 10 images and 500 words.\nApproach\nQuestion 1\nIt is observed from the datasets provided by VAST Challenge 2022 that there are two types of businesses present in Engagement, Ohio USA, namely:\nRestaurants;\nPubs\nThey will be evaluated based on:\nFrequency and number of participants’ visits;\nRevenue (participants’ spending)\nAccording to the dataset descriptions provided by VAST Challenge, all restaurants have a Prix Fixe food cost for participants to dine in and all pubs have a hourly cost to visit the pub. Therefore, assuming all visits to restaurants are for dinning, restaurants’ revenue will be calculated by number of visits times Prix Fixe food cost. Similarly, pubs’ revenue will be calculated by duration of visits times hourly cost of visits.\nAlternative approach of deriving balance difference before and after restaurants and pubs visits as spending is considered but not preferred as balance differences are inconsistent and could be due to unknown reasons.\nQuestion 2\nOne question which rides in the minds of every reader who resides or does not reside in a city is - How expensive or affordable is the cost of living here? Can a resident residing here build up a good bank balance over the years?\nKeeping the sample of 1000 participants in mind, this segment will help study the financial health of each of the participants.\nThe FinancialJournal.csv helps understand the expense in categories such as Food, Recreation, Shelter and Earnings such as Wage. (Assumption : All positive values corresponds to credit and negative ones are debited)\nTrellis Display can be used to understand the cost of living of each of the participants. This will also give us an idea on the living index of the city over the months to see if the living standard increased over the months which may have motivated participants to leave the city.\nThe sample collected consists of diverse participants. Participants can be partitioned based on the educational qualifications, Number of Household members, Interest groups (A-H), Age groups, etc. We can use such partitions to our favour to understand the similarity between groups.\nSince we are dealing with our data in monthly format, Column Graph can help us understand the expenses incurred by these groups.\nRidge plot can help us understand the distribution in the expenses over months during peak and off peak seasons\nTo understand the earning pattern of the participants, a Lorenz curve can help us understand if the rich gets richer.\nWith the help of Interactive/Coordinated plots (Example: Scattered plot), we can also understand if people who earn more, spend more and if we see any relation with joviality.\nQuestion 3\nFinancial health of the employers\nBy merging jobs.csv and employers.csv by employerId, we can find out which employer pays more and thereby we can arrive to the conclusion of financial status of employers.\nAlso by deriving Which employers have the record of most numbers of employees switching jobs, we’ll understand their workspace culture and how likely the employer(company) may be referred to ?\nEmployment patterns\nWe can also find out how many jobs does each Workplace provding with the help of jobs.csv and employers.csv\nAlso, with the help of jobs.csv file, let’s try to find if there is any correlation between employees’ pay and their educational qualification.\nTurnover Analysis\nTo analyse the turnover, let us have a close look on TravelJournal.csv. Once the data wrangling (filtering out the purpose of Work/Home commute and grouping by participantId, travelEndLocation) is performed, we are not just finding out the overall turnover percentage rate but also with the help of apprpriate visualisation we are able to find out the exact participants who have disappeared from local job market, and who have partially employed by examining the no. of rows (n).\nEarly Prototypes\n\n\n\n",
